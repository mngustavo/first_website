		<h1 class="master">My first website</h1>
		<h2 class="master">Welcome!</h2>
		<p> This is my first website using HTML and CSS. Unfortunantely, I don't have knowledge at this moment to use JavaScript or sth 
		like Django (for Python programmers). </p>
		<p> So let's go to the introduction. My name is Gustavo and at the moment when I wrote this text I'm a High School
		student at Brazil. I love English and programming, and also hardware components and it's challenges. </p>
		<p> For me, create a GitHub profle and share my progress with programming it's very important and useful for my
		career, because with that I can show what I can do in this area, and also I can help another source-code projects,
		and also they can help me. </p>
		<p> At this moment my hardware is a Dell laptop from 2018, with an Intel Core i5-7200U (2C/4T), with a range
		of clock about 2.50GHz to 3.10GHz. Also, I have 8GB of RAM (dual channel 4GBx4GB with 2400MHz) and a SATA SSD with 250GB
		of internal storage. I don't have a dedicated video-card, but an Intel HD Graphics 620 integrated graphics, but it's not
	    so important so I think it's OK. </p>
		<p> Alright, I told about my hardware, but also I need to talk about the OS. I'm using a Hackintosh with MacOS High Sierra,
		which is not so updated but it's the most compatible with my laptop, and I can use everything that i want to programming and
	    study at school. I can post my post-install files at GitHub someday, which is isn't a bad idea :) </p>
	    <p> I think that's it guys. If I remember sth more I will probably edit this text and add more colours and maybe scripts, so
	   	whenever you can, visit it ;) </p>
